# Play with Maths(Numbers)
### Built using DOM manipulating

I was very excited while making this project. Initially, I didn't know how JS plays a key role in the Wegpages. But after completing this project, I gained a clear understanding  of how JS works in Webpages and how JS works behind the scenes in dynamic Web development.

This project helped me to explore:
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Basic logic implementation with numbers (like Prime, Strong etc.)

It was all like a Fun and Educational Experience!!!
